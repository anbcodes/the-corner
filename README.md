# The Corner

A small corner of the internet for respectful discussion and debate.

The Corner is a website for long-form discussions.
It supports creating accounts, writing posts, and replying to other peopleâ€™s posts. 
One of my goals for this website was to use no client-side JS or CSS.
So there is only one line of CSS that sets the max width (to make it readable on desktop).

## Running the server

1. `git clone https://github.com/anbcodes/the-corner`
2. `npm install`
3. `tsc .`
4. `node main.js`

Everything is stored in the filesystem as JSON files at `./data`.
